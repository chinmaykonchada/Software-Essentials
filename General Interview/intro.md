My name is Chinmay, being a computer science student at gayatri vidya parishad college, i always explore new technology, build application which are useful society.

after my 1st year i build an python program which is used to calculate interest and i thought it will useful to my father and his friends but as it's not in the form of application my father told me to build one, then i started working on android app using java and build an application and send it to my father in apk format which he still using it. 

And from there my interest shifted to web technology and i did a course in udemy web development bootcamp and learned javascript, bootstrap, nodejs, express, postgresql, api. with that knowledge i developed a restaurant suggestion app where i took zomato dataset from kaggle.
