# Different Types of Operating Systms 
    Batch System
    Distributed Operating System
    Time Sharing System
    Desktop System
    Multiprocessor System
    Clustered System
    Realtime Operating System
    Handheld System

## Batch Operating System
Batch Operating system groups jobs that perform similar type of functions. These groups are treated as a batch and are executed at the same time.
- Batch systems are not designed for real-time processing, as they prioritize efficient execution of tasks in batches rather than immediate responsiveness.
- These are still utilized in specific industries that require large-scale data processing and efficient execution of repetitive tasks.

### Characteristics and Features of Batch Operating Systems
    Job scheduling
    Minimal user interaction
    Queue based processing
    Priority based execution

### Advantages of Batch Operating Systems
    Efficient Resource allocation
    Improved Throughput
    Streamlined execution
    Better control over Resources
    Scalability

## Distributed Operating System
Dos runs on network of computers enable them to work together as a single entity. Its primary purpose is to achieve efficient resource sharing, fault tolerance and scalability.
- specifically designed to distribute computing tasks across multiple interconnected systems.
- Dos employ various techniques, such as replication, distributed transactions, and consensus algorithms, to ensure data consistency across multiple nodes.

### Key Components of Distributed Operating Systems
    Network communication protocols
    Resource management and synchronization
    Distributed file systems
    Process coordination and communication

### Advantages of Distributed Operating Systems
    Resource Sharing
    Scalability
    Fault Tolerance
    Performance Improvement

## Time Sharing System 
A time sharing system is an operating system concept that allows multiple users or processes to share a single computer system simultaneously.

It divides the available computing resources, such as the CPU, memory, and peripherals, into small time intervals called time slices or quantum.

The time slices are typically very small, ranging from a few milliseconds to a few microseconds, and the context switch between tasks happens so quickly that it creates an illusion of concurrent execution.

### Characteristics and Features of Time Sharing Operating Systems
    Interactive and Concurrent Access
    Fairness and Equal Time Allocation
    Responsiveness and Real-Time Interaction
    Process Scheduling
    Context Switching

### Advantages of Time System Sharing Systems:
    Enhanced User Productivity
    Efficient Resource Utilization
    Cost Savings
    Improved System Responsiveness

They enable multitasking, interactive computing, server virtualization, cloud computing, real-time systems, collaboration, and batch processing.
