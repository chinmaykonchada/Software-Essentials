# What is System Design:
Systems Design is the process of defining the architecture, components, modules, interfaces, and data for a system to satisfy specified requirements. It involves translating user requirements into a detailed blueprint that guides the implementation phase.
## Scaling an application:
- Vertical Scaling: Optimizing processes and increasing throughput with the same resources.
- Preprocessing: Preprocessing before hand at non peak time.
- Backups: Keep backups and avoid single point failure. 
- Horizontal scaling: Hire more resources.
- Micro Services architecture: where the application is developed as a collection of services, every work is well defined.
- Distributed System: Partitioning.
- Load Balancer: a device that sits between the user and the server group and acts as an invisible facilitator, ensuring that all resource servers are used equally.
- Decoupling: separating the things.
- Logging and metrics calculations.
- Extensible.

Explains the architecture that would be used to develop a system

### Low level design:
Actual coding, like making classes, objects, functions, signatures.
